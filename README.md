# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

## Function
This app allows the user to input a segment of text, which is analyzed for bias. It returns a judgment of the positive or negative slant of the text ('polarity'), subjectivity (whether it's an opinion or objective fact), and the original text submitted.

## Techniques Used
The app calls on the Aylien Text Analysis API. Node, Webpack, and Express.js are used.

## Getting Started
Use `npm run start` and `npm run build-prod`
